Very Hard
~~~~~~~~~
Object prototype 
Object prototypal inheritance exercise

1. Person constructor (const person)
    - properties (name, job, age)
    - 'exercise' method
        - console.log('Just Keep Swimming!')
    - 'fetchjob' 
        - console.log('Tyrone is a Web-App Developer')
2. Programmer constructor (const programmer)
***Most of these will consist of if...else statements
    - inherits all of the members from Person
        - with additional 'languages' property that's passed in
        - busy property that is not passed in.
        - true by default
    - 'completeTask' method 
        - updates the busy property to be false
    - 'acceptNewtask' method
        - updates the busy property to be true
    - 'offerNewTask' method
        - console.log('Tyrone can't help right now) > if busy
        - console.log('Tyrone would love to help') > if available
    - 'learnLanguage' method
        - adds new languages to the programmer
    - 'listLanguage'  method
        - lists all the langauges that the programmer knows

        Example: 
        const person1 = new Person("Harold", "Backend Engineer", 20);
        const c1 = new Programmer("Liana", "DevOps", 35, ["HTML", "C#", "LUA"]);
        const c2 = new Programmer("Edwin", "janitor", 55, ["HTML", "SASS”, ”Ruby"]);
        const c3 = new Programmer("Manny", "SysOps", 31,[("HTML", "CSS", "JS", "R")]);
        c1.learnLanguage("CSS");
        c2.learnLanguage("C++");
        c3.learnLanguage("JAVA");
        console.log(c1.listLanguage());
        console.log(c2.listLanguage());
        console.log(c3.listLanguage());
        console.log(person1);
        console.log(c1);
        console.log(c2);
        console.log(c3);
        person1.exercise();
        person1.fetchJob();
